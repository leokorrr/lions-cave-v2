# Second version of portfolio

## @TODO
- delete backend layouts after creating admin panel on frontend
- API optimization
- check exec function. Do I need it?
- API env REACT_APP_BACKEND_API change name
- Finish or delete table optimalization in one file
- change .map in TableRow to reduce to avoid id and strange view check

### Notes
I didn't add mongoose validation because I'm the only person who can change database.
It must be done in other projects
